                    November 2019, North India was hit by sever air pollution, air quality index reached harmful levels. I t so difficult to breath,

                    always felt like something was stuck in my throat. And during the start of our design and futures studio, I saw this
                    
                    documentry “A life on our planet” by David Attenborough, I felt the sense of emergency that they tried to tell because I
                    
                    could relate with it due to my past experiences. Then studio started and I read about alternate futures. I thought about
                    
                    merging these two and bring the experience as real as possible for the viewers to experience that emergency and take
                    
                    significant actions.

                <p><b>Did any author or fiction or philosophy inspire you? How did you go about exploring the inquiry you were interested in?
                    How did you document the info you were coming across? How did you devise or plan an approach? 
                    Did you crush or prove any assumptions? How did you perform research?</b></p>

                    <p>
                        Inital lectures during the studio were a very big source of inspiration for me. I was amazed to learn about speculative design and how it has been used in the past to provoke the audience. For me studying design was an experience of a different kind, I felt so motivated by every literature I read, by every lecture I attended. I read speculative everything by Dunn and Raby. Read various articles on design fiction, critical design, etc. I kept UN sustainable goals as inspiration and read their articles. My plans was to create design fiction and I implemented it by creating some dark humor comics.

                        Turns out it isn’t as easy to provoke audience and to let them think along the same lines

                <p><b>What were certain approaches/tools/methods you used to act on your inquiry? How was your inquiry wandering off at this point? Did you start developing a tunnel vision, or boredom around your topic? How much procastinate,

                <p>
                    To communicate my ideas I choose design fiction. I researched about seculative design, saw various examples and created a dark humor

                    comic for my making activity and took it further to create some diegetic prototypes to put viewers in dilemma. There were times when I
                    
                    got saturated by reading and to cope up with that, I left working on whatever I was doing and did whatever I felt like (used social media,
                    
                    watched movies, shopping, roaming, etc.). Actually, there was a phase that I was hyper excited and couldn’t contain myself to sit in one
                    
                    place, and I am still kind of in that place. But I never stopped communicatingabout the environment and how urgent it is to take actions
                    
                    with whoever I met, this helped me understandwhat people think. My motive was to unleash my creativity and think about dystopia and
                    
                    absurdity, which wasn’t easy for me, since I am more right brained.

                    So, the coolest thing that I did was think like a kid. Let myself free. Made comics and made whatever without fearing that will it make sense or not. It was different kind of liberation. I am still working on creating some more absurd and speculative prototype. I was actually having “FUN”.

                <p><b>Put up your updated visual abstract and a brief summary of reflection</b></p>
                <p>
                    Most of what I think is already in the visual abstract. It is very important to care about our environment now. Nobody is realizing it, its just a topic for them to discuss. And I am not saying that provoking people is not an easy job. Only people who have been successful in doing that are "trend setters". For example if Gucci starts telling people to recycle their clothes everyone will. Why? because they are influential. That's how distracted 

                    people are careing about less visible and less important things. Simulating the dystopia is one step to make them care about something more important.
