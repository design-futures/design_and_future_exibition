                <p>Have you ever interacted with your smartphone or an app that simply didn’t play nice with your thumbs? Perhaps, you had to stretch your 
                    thumbs all the way across the length of your phone to perform a particular task, maybe tap on an icon, to pull down your top navigation drawer, 
                    to view your friend’s Instagram story  etc. Well, I have gone through all these difficulties to perform a task on my smartphone. Initially I questioned myself, 
                    “Is this because my thumbs are too small?”, “Do only I face this problem?”, “Do I need to train my thumbs to be an acrobat?”. Soon I resorted to 
                    just go along with it because I personally felt others might laugh at me, if I mentioned I have a reachability issue with just a 5'’ phone, 
                    when most of the people I know have bigger phones. I once brought up this topic with my friends and I got to know they too face similar concerns. 
                    Phew, I wasn’t alone. At that time I wasn’t well aware of actual researches conducted to solve reachability and thumb zone. Slowly, 
                    I started to inquire and understand reachability
                     concerns faced by people around me. Now I felt, this would be the right time to inquire and understand this topic on a research basis.</p>

                    <p>The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman, Nielson Norman Group articles, researches by Steven Hoober, and Luke Wroblewski, Interaction Design Foundation, Design and future studio inspired me to conduct my own research. As Steven Hoober said, “One nice thing about doing your own research is that you have this giant pile of data that you can refer back to whenever something sounds worth investigating”. At a time like this, where we are all stuck at homes, I felt this would be a good challenge to find alternate methods to research remotely.</p>

                <p>I still have several tabs pinned to my chrome website that I still have to read (:P). I wanted to document my process in the form of a literature review. I started with my inquiry by empathising with the smartphone consumers. I wanted to understand their preferences towards smartphones in general, their reachability concerns, their opinions etc. I conducted user research to gather insights to get an understanding. I then tried to define my inquiry, I  put together the information that I gathered and tried to analyse and synthesise them to find the core area I should focus on.</br>

                    Initially, the purpose of my research was to find alternate ways to combat reachability concerns, but upon further research and reflection, I wanted to do groundwork before heading right into the topic, so I decided to further analyse why people prefer bigger displays in general? Why did smartphone manufacturers stop producing smaller phones? Are they ready to compromise usability and experience over size?

                <p>Brands play a major role to influence for consumers smartphone choices and I wanted to get more insights to that. So during my ideation phase, I tried divergent and lateral thinking to think out of the box to try to look at it in alternative ways. I had to spy my own family for the first time to observe their phone handling patterns.



                    Speculative design zoom out beyond user-centered design and ask what the effects of our designs could be on future societies. It’s concerned with possibilities, not probabilities, pushing us to consider our preferences over a set of possible futures and the ways in which the objects we design help or hinder our attempts to build those futures. I tried to explore a possible future scenarios and ended up in creating a video of something that could happen in the future. The video
                    
                    speculates how brands influence their consumers to purchase a smartphone and the bizarre demands consumers have towards smartphones. It potentially offer insights in a comical way to what could happen if we actually embrace size over practicality and how the manufacturers have compromised user experience over its performance and features. It is based on the insights I received from the focus group survey, articles and existing researches.

                <p><b>Put up your updated visual abstract and a brief summary of reflection</b></p>
                <p>Assumptions I had before I started my research is that, smartphone consumers have reachability concerns on their phones,  they prefer larger displays and brands have an influence on their decision. What I learned from researching is that consumers have smartphone size preferences. From the survey, majority preferred larger displays for their digital devices. Out of the total 80 participants, almost 40 prefer smartphones lesser than 5.2'’. Brands play a major role as a deciding factor for smartphone purchases. Consumers are used to reachability issues and they do have a frustrating experience. Bigger the screen size, the interface should follow the thumb zone and reachability heatmaps while designing user interfaces and applications so that the users can perform their tasks seamlessly.

                    The questions I had during  last three weeks were: (1)Only four participants out of eighty has a phone less than 5.2'’. Are their choices attributable to lesser availability of compact phones in the current market or if it is their personal preference? (2) Why do we always need bigger and better version of something? Does buying bigger things give us a sense of power or does it associate with higher status? (3) Will keeping up with the trend and having the latest features decide consumer preference? Does it have to do with peer pressure or social status? (4) Does the interface solve reachability concerns since a majority use smartphones above 5.2" ? Framing these questions helped me investigate and develop my inquiry.
                    
                    Although reachability is a big part of designing for one-handed usage, it is not just about ensuring everything close to users’ reach. When we make the tasks seamless  by placing elements that are easily reachable, we save the time, remove friction, take out unnecessary steps, and most importantly focus on quickening the “one thumb, one eyeball” of apps. By gathering user data, practicing good design, and leveraging the thumb zone, I hope to find better solutions for UI that could be an alternative to reachability concerns. This inquiry helped me get a good groundwork for further research.</p>
