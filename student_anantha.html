                    Did you crush or prove any assumptions? How did you perform research?</b></p>

                    <p>I went about acquiring existing information through People's research on VR and AR, TEDx Talks, and their research. Documentation was done in a digital platform design research process, "Miro" which allowed me to stack all my information ,assumptions and speculative ideas in a single board.

                        Technological innovation is often prioritized for industries such as aerospace or automobile. This inherently favors the advancement of certain industries at the cost of other industries such as education or healthcare.</p>

                <p>I had to keep reminding myself that the studio was about speculation and not about coming up with a solution. I had to run back and forth between inquiry and research to narrowing it down to a single aspect.

                    The method used to arrange information was through design research process, which allowed me to connect the dots and rethink my inquiry.</p>

                    Virtual Reality is still in its initial phase. It would require a lot of research and development in the coming years to completely utilize VR in the educational sector. I analyzed, what were the adverse implications of the extensive use of VR to the youth age-group who are our next generation. The issues which I 
                    could analyze is an addiction to virtual simulation and other health-related issues 
                    like being paranoid or the damage to their eyes and affect in a psychological and have zero social skills with the humans.</p>
