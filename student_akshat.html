                    The rural agriculture sector and the demographic involved has been offered a lot of schemes and policies by the government for their upliftment but owing to leakages and ill-implementation and presence of power structures prompted a the exploration of a need for a systemic intervention for the prosperity of the 'farmer'.

                        The pieces of literature involved in informing the inquiry were: Speculative Everything, Everybody loves a good drought, and poverty of poor economics.

                        The research undertaken via the route of rabbit-holing on multiple points which were assumed to potentially inform the inquiry did alter the initial assumptions in the process.

                    Rabbit-holing with some constraints both at the start and during the process so as not to deviate and keeping it relevant to the inquiry. The information overload was overwhelming but turns out to be a necessary evil.
