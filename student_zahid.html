Many flora and fauna are on the edge of extinction, Can we create restorative ecosystems or design sustainable product/processthat connect us to the nature ? Finding solution for this I come  to know about many design–BIOMIMICRY , BIOPHILIC AND GREEN DESIGN. How biomimicry and biophilic , design sustainable product/process that connect us to the nature. All these thoughts and ideas fascinated and motivated me to carry these inquiries further.

                        I started searching online about biomimicry and biophilic design , I came to know about Janine Benyus is an American natural sciences writer and author. I'm reading her book “Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature”  in this book she develops the basic thesis that human beings should consciously emulate nature's genius in their designs. And read couple of other articles and watched national geographic documentary on flora and fauna. Listened many ted talks. And most important started observing many flora , fauna and putting there function and structure in to design.

                <p><b>What were certain approaches/tools/methods you used to act on your inquiry? How was your inquiry wandering off at this point? Did you start developing a tunnel vision, or boredom around your topic? How much procastinate, 
                    and how did you do that? How did you get out that "ZONE"? What is your motive and expectations from Making Activity ?
                </b></p>
                <p>
                    I used research, reading, observing, listening and exploring as a way to develop my understanding about the inquiry. I didn’t procrastinate but took break to stop over analyzing .In those brake watched national geographic documentary on flora and fauna. Listened many ted talks. And most important went outside and started observing many flora, fauna.

                    The making activity was very productive. I was able to build my thoughts and pen them down. I used many tools like 2D sketch to 3D software to build 3d product then with mesh paper to build physical product. These five weeks have been very productive in my personal growth.

                <p><b>What is the coolest shit you've pulled off in these 3 weeks if any? Is there some tangible outcome or output that came about (even a sketch or wireframe works!)? Is there any achievement/discovery/wow moment 
                    you were able to find (do upload it!)? Would you like to share some graphic/visual/aural experience of your making session (hackathon)?
                </b></p>
                <p>
                    There are many cool things that I have experienced in this studio starting from-

1. Thought experiment  on “sister walks in naked what would you do ?” and illustrated the situation of thinking.

2. Setting up Workspace And Egg drop shells...though egg broke in many drop but it was fun. “try and fail, but never fail to try ”— Jared Leto .

3. The coolest thing would be The hackathon making “TO.NEST Bird Nest with Flower Pot- Sustainable, which help in air pollution reduction, noise reduction , Biophilic and Bio-mimicry in design. It is small step to connect us with birds, plant and flowers in future” was a really great  experience as it helped me get started with the making process and also it helped me figure out different problems and possibilities. I was able to build my thoughts and pen them down. I used many tools like 2D sketch to 3D software to build 3d product then with mesh paper to build physical product. These five weeks have been productive in my personal growth. At the end I have physical product design in my hand and want to continuing working on this on larger scale how bio-mimicry in design will connect us with nature for better future.

                <p><b>Put up your updated visual abstract and a brief summary of reflection</b></p>
                <p>
                    Working on this studio gave me an understanding about how we can bring change for better future. The past few weeks have guided me in seeing everything from various perspectives.  About biomimicry - “inspired by nature” acquires a broader meaning . Brainstorm and try to find the link between the natural world and the area, product and system. How can a product, service or a building can adapts according to its geographical surroundings and local resources like nature.? What should a product take into account in order to function in the system where it is meant to be? How bio-mimicry in design will connect us with nature for better future on large scale ..? So there are many query that I have to study about. But at the end of this studio I have physical product design in my hand. “TO.NEST” Bird Nest with Flower Pot- Sustainable, which help in air pollution reduction, noise reduction , Biophilic and Bio-mimicry in design.
