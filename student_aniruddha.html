                    around the idea? What motivated you towards this? What were some assumptions and notions you had? What was the idea or thought you came across?

                <p>Initially I had started with working on IOT and automation and was thinking about coming up with some kind of product using it. But then after going through the reviews  by my peers and faculty I realised that I could work in a completely different direction where I could use speculative design to come up with an alternative world. I was particularly inspired by the work that Superflex had done in the field of speculative design. I also decided to use speculative design for my enquiry and hence came up with a concept where people live on the surface and inside water.</p>

                <p><b>Did any author or fiction or philosophy inspire you? How did you go about exploring the inquiry you were interested in?
                    How did you document the info you were coming across? How did you devise or plan an approach? 
                    Did you crush or prove any assumptions? How did you perform research?</b></p>

                    <p>While I was doing my research bit I came across a video that said - Is finding life on other planets the solution or we could simply start living on water. This sentence was my main inspiration to work in this direction. I also saw some amazing work that was done on floating cities by Oceanix. I read about how much work had been done on under water architectures and came across many amazing ideas and kept on making notes about things I felt interested me the most. So then instead of coming up with a complete plan for a city i decided to break it into different components like power, transportation etc. and came up with ideas and maps for each and at the end put it all together to come up with a very basic plan for how the city might look.</p>

                <p>I wanted to work on the concept of how the world on water and under water would look what kind of structures might exist and made a few sketches. So now i taking forward that idea I am thinking about making  such a world in virtual reality and imagine how a regular world will be in such a city and then allow the user to go around in such a world and experience it. I am working on the idea though it is a far fetched idea like how things are going about.</p>

                </b></p>
                <p>I feel the coolest thing I came up with was the renders that I came up with in blender because it was the first time I was doing it and I feel they came out be  better than what I expected. And the hackathon making was a really good experience as it helped me get started with the making process and also it helped me figure out different problems and possibilities that I could work on regarding my enquiry.</p>

                <p><b>Put up your updated visual abstract and a brief summary of reflection</b></p>
                <p>My enquiry took a total different turn from what I had eventually started. For me It was s process of opening up to new possibilities and new approaches rather than sticking to just problem solving. The making process helped me in finding many loop holes in my idea and really understood the approach of think while making. The whole process was very informative for me in various aspects and I have started having a little clarity on what I might want to work on and how to take the enquiry ahead.</p>
