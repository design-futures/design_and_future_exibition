                    My enquiry originates from a very personal place, expression is freedom for me and having dealt with resistance towards my choices of expression, I chose to work with gender as a context to explore how inherent, unconscious biases are affecting accessibility and inclusion in design.

                    Did you crush or prove any assumptions? How did you perform research?</b></p>

                        Several TED Talks and blogs inspired my enquiry, two people that really had an effect on the direction my enquiry was going in were Naveen Bagalkot and Dr. Mary John. The article "Introduction: #TravelingWhileTrans, Design Justice, and Escape from the Matrix of Domination" also helped me narrow down my field of enquiry to specifics rather than having a broad umbrella.

                    When i started, i knew it had to be gender something~ but as i progressed, it got confusing as to where exactly i should be focusing for the time being. I decided to explore Machine learning and AI with the context of gender and design. I definitely procrastinated (a lot), but since the topic of enquiry is very personal to me, i was feeling discontented and gave myself a push, the enquiry is in no way "complete", and i want to explore further into it.

                    I wanted to explore Machine Learning itself to get more clarity and subject knowledge about it for my enquiry, but I was in the state of mind that I needed to finish whatever i start for the making session, so I went with making an Instagram filter, I did finish it but I'm not satisfied with the result of the making session, as I didn't really learn anything new or come up with any new questions.

                    Exploring this enquiry opened up a lot of perspectives for me and I've learnt to look at multiple facets of a situation. Working online and not having the interactive in-person experience with the studio was a little difficult, but the enquiry helped me move slowly towards the culmination of this cycle.
