                <p>Sustainability is a term that has become an everyday word. As an architect/designer, it has always intrigued me is in today's scenario just sustainable development enough? We are facing climate change, depleting ozone layer, many flora and fauna on the edge of extinction, will sustaining the current environment for our future generations sufficient. Do we need to think a step further? Can we instead of seeing waste as something to managed or despised of, be thought of as a resource? Can we create restorative ecosystems where waste can be used as a catalyst of change? All these thoughts and ideas fascinated and motivated me to carry these inquiries further.</p>

                    <p>I started about reading various papers based on restorative ecosystems and waste up-scaling to update myself on the researches already done or ongoing. I also studied government policies and works of various organisations both government and non-government working in this sector. </p>

                </b></p>
                <p>For me major challenge was to decide upon should I keep a broader approach to my inquiry  and study about all kinds of wastes or go about studying one type of waste industry at a time. I decided better way to learn and get some concrete results out will be focusing on one set of audience for this studio. Therefore,  due to to my previous experience in construction industry, I focused on construction and demolition waste.

                <p>I created an interactive game board during 36 hour hackathon, to create a deeper understanding of why we need to think beyond 3Rs - Reduce, reuse and recycle. The learning outcomes of the game aimed at, no matter what decision players will take which make them think they are winning will ultimately end up at them all losing. As with every move they make, environmental units which I referred to as "Tragedy of the common" will either remain same or degrade. So while at individual level player might think they are winning, collectively they all are losing.</p>

                <p><b>Put up your updated visual abstract and a brief summary of reflection</b></p>
                <p>In the starting phase of my enquiry, I thought of waste as an environmental and social problem that humans need to tackle. But with 5  weeks of research and pondering upon it, I  my whole perspective of seeing things were wrong, so I have rejected my previous thinking lens, and now I think with proper research and technological inventions, waste can be re-seen as a “resource”. A resource with future potential to generate energy, new materials and products.
                     So I conclude “Waste = Resource” </p>
