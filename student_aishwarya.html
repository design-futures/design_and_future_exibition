                <p>Personal Pain Point (applied for 60 jobs at the same time): all followed the same cumbersome process - collect resumes (exaggeration), request interviews (inconsiderate of language and cultural barriers), administer assessments (prioritises English and Maths abilities), request work samples (unequal playing field), check references (selection bias).

                    Is there a less cumbersome and more engaging and fun way of doing this?</p>

                <p>I struggled to approach this as an "enquiry" - rather, I found myself assuming that gamification is the best way forward for the recruitment industry; therefore, my research was biased towards finding evidence for my assumption. So, midway into the enquiry, I made a conscious choice to think critically about my assumptions. I spent time in speculating a dystopian future of gamified recruitment.</p>

                <p>Studio 1 journey has made me more conscious of my own personal biases and their potential impact on any design solution that I create. I wondered if it's possible to train people to avoid cognitive bias and whether it is even necessary. That is, 'Is "objective" design possible and necessarily the best outcome?"



                    Also, I also came closer to understanding that "universal design" is a myth. For example, gamification of recruitment marginalises differently abled individuals and those that are on the low end of the digital divide spectrum. Should we strive for universal design? Or would this only lead to a less inclusive society?</p>
