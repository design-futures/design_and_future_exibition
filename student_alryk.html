                    my story started from exploring pollution, then sustainability, waste management next, and then focusing on how design can have a great influence in this cycle. I have been very connected and I feel my purpose is to contribute in whatever way I can to these fields that I hold close. My motivation is my need for a clear conscience while I follow my passions and that I want to create/be part of systems that respect the existing ecosystems and learn to self-regulate and give back. I believe everything is interconnected and all we need to respect these connections. My assumptions were that the path would be easy. Considering that I have been a part of this for a long time. But, the more I knew, I realised how much i have left to learn. And everything is in fact connected. Although overwhelming at times, I feel that I am on the right path and I trust the process.

                        Yes. Janine M Beynus, the concepts put forward by the Ellen MacArthur foundation have been extremely inspiring. And also, a couple of other literary articles and movies. I read articles, listened to some podcasts, searched online, went out into a garden to observe, reflected a lot, and journaled. Documentation.. so this is where I am still learning, I do not know how to visualise/or put down my thoughts when it comes to these ideas. I did plan a couple of things, and I am working with some mind maps now so that I get more clarity about the contents and I can simplify the interconnections.

                    Reading, observing, retrospection and listening were my modes of action. It wandered off when is started to focus more on the interconnections. And got quite overwhelmed in the process and started to question my existence in the end. Hehe. I took a good break. Watched a couple of rom-coms and meditated and journaled and reconnected with some old friends. But I have been working my way out of my procrastination and my anxiety, and if nothing else, these five weeks have been monumental in my personal growth. 

                    The making activity was not very productive. I was lost in my thoughts and couldnâ€™t pen them down. But I realised that I need to find solutions that work for me and then maybe think for the community and then move onto the systems.

                <p>
                    On a personal level, loads. But as far as producing results in this field and to visualise the progress in my thoughts, is something I have just begun to learn and practice.
