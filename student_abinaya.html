                <p>I began with the idea of self driving cars and imagining a future surrounding the same, once I did some research around this concept, I realised my major interest in this was to design the self driving car experience for a passenger (oriented towards problem solving and not enquiry) I also realised to successfully carry this out, I’d need to physically experience, conduct usability tests and then iterate. Considering the current circumstances, I realised this wasnt the best idea.

                    So I brainstormed about more ideas and thats when i wondered about how sustainable future would look like. This year, we have significant reductions in carbon emissions. But it took a pandemic for us to see this!! And even then plastic pollution has continued to be high due to disposable PPEs, around the world. Even citizens who have a choice to wear cloth masks, prefer to use disposable masks! The more I thought about the clearer it was to me, that things have to change. I wondered how that revolution would come about? Would it be forced by government or would it be a movement (more mainstream than current ones)? Something to the extent of Black Lives Matter happened around the world?</p>

                <p><b>Did any author or fiction or philosophy inspire you? How did you go about exploring the inquiry you were interested in?
                    How did you document the info you were coming across? How did you devise or plan an approach? 
                    Did you crush or prove any assumptions? How did you perform research?</b></p>

                    <p>The concept of sustainable futures seemed vast and I needed to go deeper to understand at-least one aspect of this. I was confused about which one to choose in terms of solar energy, wind energy, biomass, algae biofuel etc. initially. Frankly speaking I don’t have any firsthand experience of the above, except for solar energy. When I was young, I had a solar powered watch. It was a fascinating experience, I’d place it near the window and be able to use in the evenings when I played with my friends. But how does it work now I wondered?
                    </br>
                    I read more about solar energy and decided to think of a future surrounding this.
                </br>
                I initially went about documenting the info that I was learning at each stage, but this slowed me down - writing notes didnt allow me to jump from one to next with inspiration and excitement - it almost seemed to suck the fun out of it. So I just left the interesting articles’ tabs on and kept jumping around. End of the day, I’d summarise in about 20-30 words, each open tab.

                <p><b>What were certain approaches/tools/methods you used to act on your inquiry? How was your inquiry wandering off at this point? Did you start developing a tunnel vision, or boredom around your topic? How much procastinate, 
                    and how did you do that? How did you get out that "ZONE"? What is your motive and expectations from Making Activity ?
                </b></p>
                <p>My initial assumption was that I’d research and find out about solar energy’s daily life usage and possible replacement. However when I read more into it, I noticed a certain pattern in all the articles that I was reading. They were all overly optimistic and I got a sense of ‘childhood utopia’ where you’d imagine when you grow up, everything will be better. But the reality is that it wont.. These articles would list some disadvantages and issues but end on a super positive note. I wondered what would happen if solar energy replaces fossil fuels but people remained the same? Would life really be better? As I went into a rabbit hole of understanding the consequences of this, I wanted to write a story - interactive in nature that would determine outcome at each stage.. each decision taken.
                </br>
                    I now spent more time reading articles that spoke about the dangers of solar energy and the mistakes that could happen with solar energy such as the panels requiring replacement and the old ones being disposed off currently in landfills where they could soon become the next plastic (in terms of disposal), its nature to be inefficient (law of thermodynamics)
            </br>
                    I did struggle a bit at this stage of transition, since the idea is that the world gets better when we use solar energy / renewable energy - but here I was going against it! I did watch some episodes of Big Bang Theory, deep-cleaned my room (when really there was no urgency to do this) and then wondered what am i doing with my life. Then I watched a documentary called ‘water’ on Netflix that spoke about how our generation has to work for things to change.. so I thought similar to that Narrative, i can also write a visual narrative about our future and what we need to watch out for.</p>

                <p>This project helped me understand that the real problem we are trying to solve is human greed, it is not just a problem of fossil fuels, since just transferring to another energy source (even if technically renewable) would only lead us to exploit it at the same rate as fossil fuels. Even if they are renewable, there would be collateral damage. While fossil fuels mainly lead to polluting the atmosphere, other resources would inevitably lead us to pollute land / overuse important metals and natural substances in the making of solar panels (similarly with wind energy etc.). My next questions would be : How do we change the mentality of humans from 'me, me, me' to 'us'.. how do we stop being animals, but instead become humans? Would not doing this, lead to an extinction of our race?
