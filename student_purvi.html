                <p>I was interested in the subject of climate change and the destruction it will create in

                    the coming years. I decided to focus on its impact on agriculture in India. While working
                    
                    on this I mostly focused on agriculture, trying to understand how it has changed over the years.</p>

                <p><b>Did any author or fiction or philosophy inspire you? How did you go about exploring the inquiry you were interested in?
                    How did you document the info you were coming across? How did you devise or plan an approach? 
                    Did you crush or prove any assumptions? How did you perform research?</b></p>

                    <p>I was inspired by movies like India2050 and also watched various ted talks and other 

                        videos on youtube. I am also reading a book. I also met with two professionals working in this field and that helped me a lot with my enquiry.
                        
                        I noted every information that I came across. I also tried sketch noting with this project.

                <p><b>What were certain approaches/tools/methods you used to act on your inquiry? How was your inquiry wandering off at this point? Did you start developing a tunnel vision, or boredom around your topic? How much procastinate, 
                    and how did you do that? How did you get out that "ZONE"? What is your motive and expectations from Making Activity ?
                </b></p>
                <p>I mainly used research as a way to develop my understanding about the enquiry. I found it 

                    difficult to speculate and represent a future that has not happened yet. Sometimes that was 
                    
                    kind of a block for me and I couldnâ€™t come up with new ideas. </p>

                </b></p>
                <p>I have written a small document containing whatever I found out about agriculture and also 

                    a narrative.
                    
                    Getting the opportunity to know the insights of the people I met with was definitely a little achievement for me as it led me to get a better understanding of this. </p>

                <p><b>Put up your updated visual abstract and a brief summary of reflection</b></p>
                <p>Working on this project gave me an understanding about agriculture in India and how it is 

                    somewhat different from other countries. It gave me a chance to know the opinions of people 
                    
                    working in this field through discussion which I think is very important for a design process. 
                    
                    It was difficult but a good learning experience.</p>
