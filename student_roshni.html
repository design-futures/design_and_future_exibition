                    The idea was that if a city was built using renewable resources it would solve/reduce the environmental concerns we face present day.

                        Mostly online research. Looking into where and what's already been implemented and what materials were used and could be used. I came across Green Architecture and then proceeded from there

                    The questions that I starting thinking about were, Could this be implemented in India in the distant future? assuming yes then how? what would be done small scale? and so on. I also ended up focusing solely on the buildings.

                    Through jotting down small notes and rough doodles I was able to narrow down 5 types of buildings to focus on - Shops, Schools, Office buildings, Apartments and Restaurants. and what partial green architecture could be implemented(even on a small scale). And the use of Solar energy and Rain water harvesting to be implemented in all 5 typed, wherein the rain water collected either be filtered and reused or be directed to the earth to help replenish ground water. The implementation of Grey water Recycling especially in restaurants and apartments. And the use of renewable materials being used for the construction of the buildings.

                <p>
                    through the course of the studio my initial inquiry shifted from minimising environmental damage to focusing solely on the possible implementation of green architecture. I did not stop to consider other possible alternatives. I got engrossed to the concept of Green Architecture and I learnt about it.
