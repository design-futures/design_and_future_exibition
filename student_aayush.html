                </p>
                <p>The origin of the enquiry was a simple question : Could we have a future where humans selflessly understand each other’s needs and thrive collectively ?



                </br>The more I thought about this as an alternate future, more the need to understand Humans arose. In order to understand humans, I figured I had to understand and comprehend their behaviour in various scenarios and in response multiple stimuli. My main motivation was seeing people in daily life, being ignorant of the needs of others and also the repercussions of their actions. I saw people behave selfishly without considering anything but their needs. This helped me form a base for my inquiry and leading me to focus on the core element that builds our future, us humans.
                    
                    
                    
            </br> I believe in order to go forward into the future, we as humans need to have a better understanding for things and people around us. The time to be selfish is long past gone and anything in this direction is going to take us backwards rather than towards a future we all dream of. If you take a look around at the moment, you will see that we had imagined a future very different from what we currently are in and the only cuff binding us is being inconsiderate. Adrienne Marie Brown beautifully gives examples of, how birds fly together in large formations without colliding and how plants thrive by interconnecting their roots. This makes me wonder,  why can't us humans together be blocks of Jenga and build towards a better future.</p>

                    <p>During the course of my research, I read up on a lot of authors and watched talks by many an inspirations, to understand what their thoughts were, regarding the future of our society and how we as a part of it could bring about change. One such talk was by Srilatha Batliwala and her mention of Donella Meadow’s various leverage points to the incidents of intervention and the power to transcend or restructure society’s paradigm of an “Ideal Human”. This helped bring clarity to my idea and as to how it could be approached and dealt with. Furthermore, an article by our very own Naveen Bagalkot, on how to design "with" and not "for", compelled me to review my own thoughts on the process of thinking with people and not for them. There are numerous such literary and rhetorical devices that I cannot seem to recall as of now, but these helped me refine my initial idea. They helped me focus and work on a single pixel on the huge screen called society, if change is to be brought. Thus began my process of mapping behavioural changes in us humans by talking to people and empathising with them to learn their point of view and perspective on the issues dwelling among us. The more I tried to answer the "simple" question, the more complex it became. Going deeper into this, I deduced my need to focus on the cause of the problem rather than running after a solution, and one cause of erratic behavioural changes was Depression. This seemed to be a huge deterrent in our goal of being selfless and moving ahead together to shape an ideal societal architecture. There were of course many a remedies in this modern era, both digital and traditional, to treat depression, but none that could transcend the fail-safe method of conversation. The question to ask then became, how could such an age old method challenge our modern advancements and what could we learn from this ongoing method to craft Panacea. I began by conversing with close friends and family who had been fighting depression for sometime now and understanding their wants, needs and restraints, in order to help them. The overall goal was to listen-reflect-think-help.</p>

                </b></p>
                <p>During the research and ideation phase, I realised that the best tool that I could utilise to have a better understanding of my study were is humans. The huge amount of potential that we have incapacitated inside of us, is unmatched by any other being that we currently know of, and if we want to delimit our the latency, we need to understand ourselves. Thus the logical and already practices method that I used was informal interviewing. It was surprising to see how easily people are willing to confide in you if they come across an ear that actually wants to hear what they have to say. This only made me confident of my journey into helping them to the best of my capacity and forgetting about changing the societal architecture as a whole, for now.



                    I started by reading up the ample resources available online, on The What's, How's and Why's concerned with depression and mapping them (please download the PDF available on my Miro Board for a detailed documentation of my learnings and research resources). After getting a better understanding of the depth I was stepping into, I began cross-verifying my learnings by interviewing individuals fighting the battle. To my surprise, a 20 minute conversation with them gave me more in-depth and personal insights into the condition, which 5 hours of scurrying the internet couldn't. They made me browse the world through their perspective which we, amidst all noise, fail to see. Every conversation, helped me narrow my focus to a more deliberate stance and not did I once wander. Each time that I now get lost in the confusion, I go back to the first ever conversation I had and it helps me notice the frailty of our common perspective. Something that really struck me during the conversations was, all of them had something common, a rabbit-hole (something that all of us have), but of negative thoughts, emotions and reactions. This was the something that all us blessed ones fail to notice or attend. This very thought gave me an idea to explore a world made by these individuals and for these individuals in my making activity.</p>

                <p>"If you are going to fail, fail fast" by Keith Richards and "Fail early, fail often, but always fail forward" by John C. Maxwell, best describes the objectives of the Making activity. After all I had learnt and worked on for the past few weeks and looking at the question that I had started with, I figured if I had to make something valuable, why not craft a world that would make sense to the people living in it. I decided to use Minecraft, a sandboxing game that allows you to create your imagination, to try and create an example of such a virtual world. My objective of creating such a world was to help a person dealing with Depression, feel at home, loved and surrounded by positivity as they would feel in their alternate perfect world. During the interviewing, I asked the participants in humour, what their ideal world would look like, expecting nothing substantial, but who could have guessed it would be the founding base for my prototyping activity. All of them had vivid descriptions and elements ready to put into action. All they needed was the prodding question of "what would it look like ?". But again, the interesting bit to note is the common element in all those imaginations, the freedom to choose. This became my defining goal in the virtual world, giving the users the freedom to choose every aspect and element that could be thought of, from the weather to the time of day, from the number of fish in the sea to people inhabiting the world. It would all be their choice, in their own private space. I went ahead creating a version of my personal ideal world to test the waters and see the practicality in this exercise and was I amazed. There were certainly quite a few limitations and constraints in using the tool, but it gave me a fair idea of what I imagined a perfect world was not that perfect. I discovered that Utopia and Dystopia go hand-in-hand and have more than a few overlapping elements. One such example was my Avatar while riding a horse in the forest, falling into a huge crater and nobody to help because visitors were denied access. I could fly out, given it was a world created by me, but unfortunately my horse couldn't (limitation). Alongside you can see a few sample screens from virtual world, titled Utopia, which now needs to be renamed.</p>

                    The past few weeks have guided me in seeing everything from various perspectives and not just one. I have learnt that in order to make, we first need to break, tear and rip apart, to understand it's underlying elements, before we can reconstruct something valid and useful. The exploration of Utopia helped me understand how everything in a world is connected and that any change affects multiple vertices, the base of relations and connectivity. What I need to do next is explore the Dystopian world as I explored the Utopian world, to understand its limitations. Once I have explored both sides, only then will I be able to understand how they both complement or supplement each other and their Interrelation. I am hoping that from this, I will be able to generate a more viable and realistic understanding to the problem of the lack in interpersonal relations, which will pave the way to answer my original concern of a thriving community.
